               And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:
               <br>
               And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
               <br>
               Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
               <br>
               Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.

               Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
               <br>
               Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
               <br>
               Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
               <br>
               Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
            </div>

               Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
               <br>
               Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousnessâ€™ sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
               <br>
               Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
